## The rewritten version of ShadowAntiCheat for Minecraft:Bedrock Edition

## Status: Discontinued Indefinitely. Mojang has unfortunately decided that they want to implement EULA changes that I consider completely unacceptable, hence I am unwilling to provide any content for their game at the moment: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/usage-guidelines

- Angle <b>(complete)</b>
- CombatHeuristics <b>(in progress, 70% complete)</b>
