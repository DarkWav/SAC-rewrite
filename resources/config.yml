# === Speed Check === #
#
# Do you want to enable the Speed check?
# NOTE: If you disable this, you will not be protected from
# Combat Hacks which focus on fast movement such as TP-Aura.

Speed: true

# How many blocks per second may a player run to be considered legit?
# Default: 8.0.
# Increase this if you get Speed false positives.

Speed.MaxMove: 8.0

# How many moves must a Player perform with unlegit Speed to be punished?
# Default: 8
# Increase this if you get Speed false positives.

Speed.Threshold: 8

# Which punishment should be performed when a player is detected for Speed?
# "kick"  = kick the player
# "block" = drag the player back and freeze him

Speed.Punishment: "kick"

# Wich message do you want the punished player to be kicked with?

Speed.KickMessage: "[SAC] > You were kicked for using Speed!"

# === Angle Check === #
#
# Do you want to enable the Angle check?
# This prevents players from hitting targets behind them.

Angle: true

# With how much Angle should a player be allowed to hit?
# Measured in degrees from pointing direcrion
# Default: 90 (= block hits behind the player)
# You can lower this when only having Windows 10 Players.

Angle.Limit: 90

# How far away must a player be from its target for the angle check to actually check it?
# Default: 1.5

Angle.MinDistance: 1.5

# Which punishment should be performed when a player is detected for Angle?
# "kick"  = kick the player
# "block" = cancel the illegal hits

Angle.Punishment: "kick"

# How many times must a Player hit with unlegit angles to be kicked?
# Has no effect if punishment is set to "block".
# Default: 10
# Increase this if you get Angle false positives.

Angle.Threshold: 10

# Wich message do you want the punished player to be kicked with?

Angle.KickMessage: "[SAC] > You were kicked for using KillAura!"

# === Combat Heuristics === #
#
# Do you want to enable Combat Heuristics?
# This advanced algotithim detects various suspicious
# combat behavior patterns which indicate that the player
# is using an unlegit client modification allowing him/her
# to behave in a way a normal player couldn't.
# This is used to detect not-so-blatant combat hacks such as AimBot, FastClicks,
# some KillAura variations and FightBots.

CombatHeuristics: true

# How aggressive should the combat heuristics be configured?
# The higher, the faster cheaters are flagged, but false positives also become more likely
# The lower, the slower cheaters are flagged, but false positives also become less likely
# Valid options are:
# 0 - custom senstivity - configurable in advanced.yml
# 1 - low senstivity
# 2 - normal sensitivity (default)
# 3 - high sensitivity

CombatHeuristics.Sensitivity: 2

# How many hits should the combat heuristics analyze
# to obtain average values?

CombatHeuristics.AnalyzedHits: 8

# Modules
# These will check for different suspicious behavior.

# Do you want to enable the Distance module?
# Checks average distance between targets in fights.

CombatHeuristics.Modules.Distance: true

# Do you want to enable the Accuracy module?
# Checks how accurately player look at their target when hitting.

CombatHeuristics.Modules.Accuracy: true

# Do you want to enable the Consistency module?
# Checks how consistent the aim angle of a player is during fights.

CombatHeuristics.Modules.Consistency: true

# Do you want to enable the ClickSpeed module?
# Checks if players are hitting too fast.

CombatHeuristics.Modules.ClickSpeed: true

# Info: AngleDistanceRelation and SpeedDistanceRelation were previously known as AKAHAD.

# Do you want to enable the AngleDistanceRelation module?
# Simmilar to the Distance module, but automatically sets more strict limitations
# as the player hits with higher angles.

CombatHeuristics.Modules.Distance.AngleDistanceRelation: true

# Do you want to enable the SpeedDistanceRelation module?
# Simmilar to the Distance module, but automatically sets more strict limitations
# as the player moves faster.

CombatHeuristics.Modules.Distance.SpeedDistanceRelation: true

# How many times must a player be acting suspiciously to be kicked?

CombatHeuristics.Threshold: 24

# Wich message do you want the punished player to be kicked with?

CombatHeuristics.KickMessage: "[SAC] > You were kicked for Suspicious Combat Behavior!"
